      <description>How could we copy a folder from AWS S3 to local machine using AWS CLI?
Use cp command We can use cp command to copy folder or file from S3 to local machine. If we add parameter --recursive then we will get folder with all its files and folder inside. Example:
aws s3 cp s3://bucketname/foldername localdirname --recursive  This will copy folder foldername with all its content inside from S3 to local folder named localdirname.</description>

      <description>Problem Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine that we need to return JSON form of the following Java object:
import java.util.Date; public class A { private String name; private List&amp;lt;Date&amp;gt; dates; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } public List&amp;lt;Date&amp;gt; getDates() { return dates; } public void setDates(List&amp;lt;Date&amp;gt; dates) { this.dates = dates; } }  If we return this class &amp;lsquo;as is&amp;rsquo;, without any helping directives to JSON serializer, we could get it in the following form:</description>

      <description>The problem with AWT headless app in Spring Boot Recently I needed to create console Java Spring Boot app that does some stuff with AWT (not so important what exactly). I found that simple run with a normat Spring Boot stub simply does not work. Running this:
@SpringBootApplication public class MyAwtApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(MyAwtApplication.class, args); } }  generates following exception when AWT-related processing happens:</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine that we have a project, which actually use AWS S3 as file storage. The project consists of 2 parts: one part puts files into S3, and the other part only reads them from S3. Moreover, files are stored not in the bucket root, but in some folder which is placed in the bucket root.
According to best AWS practices, we need 2 security and access control policies. One policy is for that part of software which puts files into S3 folder.</description>

      <title>How SSH get port 22</title>

      <description>A nice story from SSH creator (Tatu Ylonen) about how SSH got its port 22.
Briefly, initial SSH version was created in Spring 1995, time when FTP and Telnet were widely used. SSH was designed to replace FTP (port 21) and Telnet (port 23). Port 22 was free. So it was chosen to be used in SSH. At that time Internet was small, and port numbers were allocated by IANA, managed by Internet pioneers Jon Postel and Joyce K.</description>

      <description>This is a first post which describes how to solve some particular programming task. Today we will consider Stone pile task from Timus. It is clear and easy. The task sounds like:
Task Stone pile
Task You have a number of stones with known weights w1, …, wn. Write a program that will rearrange the stones into two piles such that weight difference between the piles is minimal.
Input Input contains the number of stones n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and weights of the stones w1, …, wn (integers, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100000) delimited by white spaces.</description>
