      <description>This is a first post which describes how to solve some particular programming task. Today we will consider Stone pile task from Timus. It is clear and easy. The task sounds like:
Task Stone pile
Task You have a number of stones with known weights w1, …, wn. Write a program that will rearrange the stones into two piles such that weight difference between the piles is minimal.
Input Input contains the number of stones n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and weights of the stones w1, …, wn (integers, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 100000) delimited by white spaces.</description>
