      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is the task: implement the core of ad aggregator, abstracting away from network details.

And do it all in a thread-safe non-blocking manner.&lt;/p&gt;

So it was chosen to be used in SSH. At that time Internet was small, and port numbers were allocated by IANA, managed by Internet pioneers Jon Postel and Joyce K.</description>
